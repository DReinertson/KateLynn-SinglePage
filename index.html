       <p>This collection of poetry and prose carries you along a personal journey through love, loss, joy, abuse, wonder, femininity and empowerment. This is a story of bravery. A story of becoming amongst the shattering. A story of truth.

She has found a passion in many artistic outlets including paiting, drawing, and writing. More detials here! I need to type more to see how the text will be affected if it is longer. I just need to continue typing things to see how many lines this can handle and what it will look like with a longer bio. But not too long cause I don't want to ruin the "About" section.<a href = "#" class = 'author-item' id = 'read-more'> read more</a></p>

      <h1>About Kate</h1>
      <p>I want the intro to be something that is a brief overview of Kate as a person and as an author. It should only be about 3 sentences. Something witty and fun would be nice.</p>
      <p>The first paragraph will be about the things that Kate has done professionally. Here is where we can divulge into what went into writing certain books. This is also where we can talk about future potential projects and things that Kate is proud of doing. </p>
      <p>The last paragraph will be more about the personal stuff. This is where we can talk about who she is, where she is from, and about her family. This is where we can also talk about how she uses her enviornment and people around her to inspire her for her creative works. We can also use this opportunity to talk about her extra artistic adventures. Maybe include a picture or two showing her drawings, paintings, random poetry, musical lyrics etc. I would like to show personality in this paragraph for sure.</p>

    <p>I changed my mind. I want more about what went into this book, the journey that Kate went through in order to gain inspiration for this. What the general theme of the story is, what it meant to complete, things like that. Use the Amazon description on the front page and more in depth here. Or vice versa.</p>

      <p>We'll put some text here to see what it looks like, I want to see how text works with pictures added and how big of a picture I would like to use. How to separate posts from each other and where text lies next to the picture.

     <p>Putting in some more text, seeing how two blog posts look one after another. Really going to drag this out in order to have multiple lines of the page taken up. Trying to cover a lot of the page to see how everything is spaced out, especially once I start getting passed the view-height of the page, i.e. needing to have a scroll bar to continue to look at posts. Will also have to remember that the newest blog post needs to go at the top.</p>
