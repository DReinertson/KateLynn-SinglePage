        Kate Lynn currently creates on an island in the Puget Sound. She has found her passion in writing poetry and prose, singing, photography, and painting. Capturing the life she witnesses and crafting it into art to share with others is her passion. She believes that we are all given our stories and talents for a reason, and that it&rsquo;s in the blending of the two where we can find our voice.

      <h2>About Kate</h2>
      <img class = 'aboutPicture' src = '../images/katieBeach.JPG'>
      <p>
        Kate Lynn has been an artist since a young age. She has always been drawn to nature, finding herself most at home amongst the shores and in the forests. Her ideal days are spent exploring during the day and crafting her stories at night.
        <br>
        <br>
        Kate is a self-proclaimed &ldquo;westcoastian&rdquo; having lived in California, Oregon, and Washington. Home was found on an island nestled in the Puget Sound, where she spends her days sitting with the waves and walking under the forest canopies. Her inspiration comes primarily from her experiences and relationships throughout her life, and the nature that surrounds her. In addition to her poetry, Kate is known for photography, painting, and singing. She has recently been exploring the blending of these medias and creating works that tell her stories through a wider lens.

      <br>
      <p>
        In 2018 Kate produced and self-published her first book &ldquo;To Love Well&rdquo;. With this book she fell in love with the creative process of crafting a story told by poems woven together. Before the manifestation of this book she always knew that she needed to share her story, and was in constant search of the outlet that it was meant to be told through. When she found free verse poetry and prose, it all unfolded and the journey became effortless. Since then Kate has been writing everyday and beginning to weave together her next piece.

        When it came time to create &ldquo;To Love Well&rdquo; Kate gathered her journals from over the years, notebooks, and poems scribbled on scrap paper. She revisited moments of heartache, love, trauma, bliss and began approaching each of those experiences with a gentle heart. Letting herself fully feel those moments, Kate was able to begin walking through her own story as not just the character, but as the reader. She asked herself &ldquo;what did I feel then?&rdquo; &ldquo;how did I move through this?&rdquo; and lead herself through those years over again. Through this process of reliving and guiding herself along those memories with absolute honesty and through a creative lens had a miraculous effect on her emotional and mental health. Diving deeper and deeper she found the magic within those days of pain and can now look at her present experiences as moments of learning for future works of art.
        <br>
        <br>
        The relationship between experience and creation for Kate has now become a fluid act all on its own, and she often finds herself overflowing with ideas of how to explain her experiences. As she allows herself to now walk everyday open to all possibilities she is finding new perspectives and inspirations that were once invisible to her. Allowing herself to experience everything she can, she hopes she can then be a guiding hand for another. One of the main motivations for her work is to process fully and then be able to teach another. As she has learned from those before and surrounding her, she hopes to be that friend for another.

      <p>We'll put some text here to see what it looks like, I want to see how text works with pictures added and how big of a picture I would like to use. How to separate posts from each other and where text lies next to the picture.

     <p>Putting in some more text, seeing how two blog posts look one after another. Really going to drag this out in order to have multiple lines of the page taken up. Trying to cover a lot of the page to see how everything is spaced out, especially once I start getting passed the view-height of the page, i.e. needing to have a scroll bar to continue to look at posts. Will also have to remember that the newest blog post needs to go at the top.</p>
